# The Game

Within these pages lies an ancient tome transcribing a venerable rite cherished by our people throughout the eons. Aspiring summoners, yearning for enlightenment, engage in a grand contest, vying against each other to transcend mortal bounds and attain heightened consciousness.

Behold, the sacred tenets of this mystical contest are revealed as follows.

Summoners who dare to partake must attune their senses, listening for the beckoning of ethereal connections, through which their minds shall journey to the hallowed ritual plane. Between each iteration of the ritual, new minds can be forged, molded into existence, and imbued into the ethereal storage, known as the "docker registry", aligned exclusively with the summoner's essence.

The ritual plane itself manifests as a desolate, levitating platform, spanning fifty celestial units, fraught with perilous pitfalls and impenetrable terrain. Upon this plane, each awakened mind shall traverse, striving to prolong its survival in this realm of mystery and wonder. In the pursuit of longevity, one may harness their magical energies to outmaneuver their fellow seekers. With each cosmic alignment, a malevolent fog encroaches upon the players, prompting them to combat for the dwindling space.

Across this mystical expanse, the platform exhibits diverse terrain, with each tile holding its own arcane attributes:

- The desert allows all to traverse freely without hindrance.
- The bush conceals entities from distant adversaries, shrouding them in obscurity.
- The mountain stands as an unyielding fortress, barring passage to all who dare to traverse its majestic peaks.
- The water lake acts as an aqueous sanctuary, entrapping summoners who fall within its depths, compelling them to forfeit a turn to teleport out.
- The lava lake serves as an infernal abyss, consuming the essence of any summoner unfortunate enough to plunge into its molten embrace.
  In the mystical cadence of each cosmic tick, summoners wield their powers, granted four choices to shape their fate:

- To move, swiftly traversing to an adjacent location, seeking advantage or retreat.
- To push, coercing another entity away, casting them into the treacherous realms of lava or water.
- To punch, afflicting a fellow adversary with a measured degree of anguish.
- To summon, conjuring forth a loyal minion, sworn to heed their call.

With each action taken, summoners must beware, for within this plane, their health and mana are finite. The latter can be automatically rejuvenated through communion with the void, while the former can only be replenished through the act of stealing vitality from an enemy. However, this process proves arduous, allowing only meager portions of vitality to be restored at a time. A fateful demise befalls any summoner, their life force becoming an ephemeral current, flowing towards the last summoner who wrought any form of harm.

## Game key features

- Once awakened, the fog commences its enigmatic dance, beginning to dwindle after the passage of 20 in-game ticks. Thereafter, its ethereal form undergoes a metamorphosis every 10 ticks, shrinking evermore.
- The summoner's vision extends across 10 tiles, granting them glimpses of the arcane tapestry that weaves around them.
- The fog's malevolent touch inflicts 20 wounds upon any entity it embraces during each inexorable tick.
- The summoner, an aspirant of great power, holds dominion over their corporeal form, with life and mana bound by finite limits. A celestial equilibrium blesses them with 100 life and 100 mana, both granted at their fullest as the ritual commences.
  The summoner's mana regenerates 1 mana point for each tick, a humble gift from the void itself.
  The summoner may summon as many minions as they are willing, provided the mana in their possession is enough.
  When the ritual turns lethal, and a summoner's life succumbs to the void, a glimmer of hope arises amidst the darkness. 50 life essence returns to the last summoner causing harm, alongside 2 additional points at the ritual's end, a testament to their prowess and might. But heed this, for the adjudication of death lies not solely upon the player who deals the fatal blow. The player who last pushes a foe, driving them into the grasp of the gas or the embrace of lava, earns the mantle of executioner and the credit for the vanquished foe's demise.

## Scoring

As the mystic ritual draws to its conclusion, each summoner shall be bestowed with points in accordance with the order of their demise. The fortunate soul to stand as the last survivor shall be graced with a grand total of 10 points, a testament to their mastery and resilience. The penultimate participant, who valiantly clung to existence until the end, shall be rewarded with 7 points, a commendable achievement indeed.

Following closely, the summoner who met their fate just before the runner-up shall claim 5 points, a respectable showing in the face of the mystical trials. The one who departed two steps before the third shall grasp 4 points, an acknowledgment of their tenacity and prowess.

Next in line, the summoner who journeyed to the ethereal realm's departure shall be granted 3 points, an acknowledgment of their courage and spirit. Likewise, the participant who succumbed two steps before this stage shall be granted 2 points, a testament to their resilience and skill.

Lastly, the summoner who embraced their fate just before the two-point achiever shall be gifted 1 point, a token of recognition for their valiant efforts.

Finally, 5 additional points are provided to the last summoner causing harm as a summoner's life succumbs to the void.

This is the cosmic ballet of life and death, where mana waxes and wanes, and the fog breathes its toxic fury. In the pursuit of victory, may the summoners navigate these arcane rules and harness their power to emerge triumphant, transcending mortal bounds and ascending to the pinnacle of mystical glory.

## The minions

### Armadillo

The mighty armadillo is a guardian spirit bound by ancient oaths to its venerable owner. This mystical creature, with its formidable shell, stands resolute against the onslaught of great adversities, shielding its master from harm's way.

### Magic Arrow

- Health: 1
- Mana cost: 10
- Speed: 3
- Damage: 25
- Vision radius: 10

Within the enchanted arsenal of mystic weaponry lies the wondrous creation known as the magic arrow. Crafted by adept sorcerers, this arcane projectile possesses an extraordinary trait: the ability to be guided through the control of its ethereal connections. When unleashed by a summoner, it streaks across the firmament with remarkable speed, as if blessed by the very winds themselves. However, this swift journey is ephemeral, for the arrow quickly loses its velocity, slowing down as it traverses the celestial expanse.

Yet, a marvel unfurls as the arrow defies the constraints of time and space. Endowed with everlasting flight, it can soar tirelessly through the skies, traversing the heavens with boundless determination.

In its ethereal existence, the magic arrow wields unique potency against airborne adversaries. Unfazed by the limitations of terrestrial foes, it possesses the ability to strike with unerring precision those who share the realm of flight. When its path intersects with that of a fellow entity, it fulfills its purpose and vanishes, leaving behind no testament to its mystical might.

### Cat

- Health: 20
- Mana cost: 20
- Speed: 1
- Vision radius: 10

In the realm of mystical beings, there resides a creature known as the cat, a marvel of grace and keen perception. Within the depths of its mesmerizing gaze lies a gift bestowed by ancient enchantments: the ability to perceive the presence of the nearest enemy summoner, regardless of the expanse that separates them.

### Dragon

- Health: 1
- Mana cost: 20
- Speed: 1
- Vision radius: 10

The powerful dragon, a majestic force of nature, is endowed with wings that grant it mastery over the skies. It soars with grace and grandeur, freely navigating over the most treacherous of liquids, unbound by the constraints of land, water, or lava. From the heights of the skies, the dragon's watchful eyes peer down upon the realm below, relaying vital information to its master.

Yet, despite its grandeur and formidable presence, the dragon's fate is inextricably tied to an ancient adversary â€“ the magic arrow. A creation of unparalleled mystic might, the magic arrow possesses the unique ability to seek out its target with unerring accuracy. Swift as a bolt of lightning, the arrow strikes true, and upon meeting the powerful dragon, it claims victory with but a single touch. In an instant, the dragon's magnificent form is stilled, and it succumbs to the potency of the enchanted projectile.

### Mole

- Health: 40
- Mana cost: 20
- Speed: 1
- Vision radius: 10
- Ability: 3 uses of orogeny

As the borrowing mole traverses the land, its movements leave behind a trail of awe and wonder. Mountains that once stood as imposing barriers are rendered asunder, their mighty forms yielding to the relentless force of the mole's passage. With every stride, it reshapes the very landscape, paving the way for its summoner to forge ahead, unhindered by the mightiest of obstacles.

Yet, the borrowing mole's mastery over the earth does not end with destruction, for it wields a sublime art known as orogeny. In the blink of an eye, it can harness the essence of the earth, employing its mystic prowess to create new mountains, thrusting them forth from the very ground it traverses. These newfound peaks rise with incredible speed, forming barriers that may serve as protective fortresses or strategic vantage points for its summoner.

### Mouse

- Health: 10
- Mana cost: 20
- Speed: 1
- Vision radius: 10
- Ticks alive: 20

The mouse, a creature of cunning and illusion, possesses the ability to shield its master from the watchful eyes of the formidable cat, shrouding them in a veil of deception. In a mesmerizing display of mastery over disguise, the mouse takes on the appearance of the seen target, diverting the cat's attention from its true quarry.

Yet, the mouse's arcane talent comes with a caveat, for its presence upon the plane is but ephemeral. Like a flickering candle in the night, its corporeal form wanes with each passing moment. Swiftly, it vanishes from sight, returning to the mystical realms from whence it came, leaving the cat to realize the ruse it unwittingly followed.

### Spectre

- Health: 10
- Mana cost: 10
- Speed: 1
- Vision radius: 2

Mindless in its existence, the spectre's purpose is confined to ceaseless drifting in one direction, an eternal journey without a destination. Yet, within this seemingly simple nature lies a profound gift for its summoner.

Endowed with the ability to traverse any terrain with effortless grace, the spectre glides through mountains and obstacles as if they were mere illusions. Its form passes unhindered through all barriers, bestowing its summoner with a small but invaluable area of vision.

Though the spectre's movement knows no bounds, its summoner wields limited control over its course. The only command the summoner may give is the power to temporarily halt the spectre's eternal drift. Upon receiving this directive, the spectre comes to a standstill, anchoring itself in its current location.

But alas, like a spectral phantom, the spectre's existence is tethered to the confines of the map. Once it reaches the edge of this mystical plane, it fades into the enigmatic darkness from whence it came, departing the world of the living.

### Wolf

The wolf stands as a symbol of power and ferocity, a marvel of strength and cunning.
This majestic being possesses a striking ability, one that instills fear in the hearts of adversaries and leaves a trail of awe in its wake.
With a single mighty swipe of its sharp claws, the wolf can deal a devastating blow to any foe within its reach.
Yet, the wolf's true mastery lies in its ability to unleash a whirlwind of destruction, using its fearsome claws to lash out at multiple enemies within its close vicinity. Like a tempest of fury, it pummels its foes with relentless assaults, leaving no refuge for those who dare stand in its path.

## Mind control

In the mystical tomes of old, the inner workings of summoned minions are veiled in arcane complexity. The aspiring summoner must tread cautiously, lest they strain the delicate threads that bind these beings to corporeal existence, risking their return to the realm of pure energy.

Within this grimoire, we impart wisdom on common operations and mystical structures that shall empower you to successfully program these ethereal entities.

Minions are but pawns, governed by an enchanted compendium of spells, which we shall now refer to as "instructions." These incantations are usually woven together in a linear fashion, enabling the execution of elaborate enchantments.

Every instruction wields power over a limited number of magical repositories, known as "registries." The lesser minions, most suitable for fledgling summoners, are bound to 32 ordinary registries, along with a special one dedicated to tracking differences.

The nature of these wondrous registries transcends comprehension, for they can harbor a myriad of knowledge â€“ be it whole numbers, known as "integers", fractions, known as "floats", true and false values, known as "booleans," and ephemeral vocal messages known as "strings". Through delving into the abyssal depths, the summoner can expand these storages infinitely, metamorphosing them into enigmatic "random access arrays". Yet, each array may contain only a singular type of information.

But beware, dear summoner, lest you attempt to extract data from incompatible registries. Such folly would undoubtedly unleash a cataclysmic surge of energy, causing the summoned minion to vanish into the ether.

Behold, there exist esoteric instructions that wield dominion over time itself, enabling the execution of complex rituals, including enchanting loops and enigmatic jumps.

Lastly, know this â€“ a moment shall arise when the minion is liberated from the bindings of its spell and roams unshackled. This liberation comes to pass when three extraordinary instructions are cast:

- "MoveTo" â€“ compelling it to traverse the mystical planes.
- "UseAbility" â€“ commanding it to wield its magical prowess.
- "DoNothing" â€“ directing it to bide its time in patient repose.
